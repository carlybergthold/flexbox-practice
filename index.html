            <h2>Item 1</h2>
            <p>The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow.</p>

        <div class="item item2">
            <h2>Item 2</h2>
            <p>It takes dark in order to show light. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. All those little son of a guns. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington.</p>

        <div class="item item3">
            <h2>Item 3</h2>
            <p>There it is. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Just use the old one inch brush. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. It is a lot of fun. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="item item4">
            <h2>Item 4</h2>
            <p>We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Just make a decision and let it go. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. Use what you see, don't plan it. Imagination is the key to painting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="item item5">
            <h2>Item 5</h2>
            <p>Don't fiddle with it all day. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. There we go. Let's build an almighty mountain.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="item item6">
            <h2>Item 6</h2>
            <p>You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. All kinds of happy little splashes. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day.</p>
